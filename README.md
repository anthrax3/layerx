# Container Scheduling across Clusters

**Layer-X** is a framework for connecting **distributed applications** with **resource clusters** in a *vendor-agnostic* way.

**Layer-X** abstracts the interface to cluster managers like [*Mesos*](http://mesos.apache.org/), [*Kubernetes*](http://kubernetes.io/), and [*Docker Swarm*](https://docs.docker.com/swarm/), allowing any application that runs Docker containers to run identically on any resource manager.

In the **Layer-X** world:
* **Resource Providers** offer nodes with useable resources (e.g. a [Mesos Slave](https://open.mesosphere.com/reference/mesos-slave/), a [Kubelet](http://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/kubelet/), or a [Swarm Node](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/add-nodes/)) to be consumed by
* **Task Providers**, which create services and perform work by launching Docker containers (e.g. [Marathon](https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/), [Deis](http://deis.io/))
* **Brains** interface with the **Layer-X** HTTP API to manage the global state of the cluster, including scheduling *tasks* on *nodes*.

**Layer-X** abstracts specific implementations of **task providers** and **resource-providers** with **Task Provider Interfaces** (TPIs) and **Resource Provider Interfaces** (RPIs). Currently, TPI and RPI have only been completed for Mesos, but Kubernetes and Docker Swarm will be available soonâ„¢.

**Layer-X** implements a simple interface for adding TPIs and RPIs to encourage easy community contributions for new resource providers (Nomad, Hadoop, etc.) and task providers (Dokku). Client APIs for TPIs are visible [here](./layerx-core/layerx_tpi_client/layerx_tpi.go) and for RPIs [here](./layerx-core/layerx_rpi_client/layerx_rpi.go).

**Brains** are also designed to be pluggable, 3rd party extensions for **Layer-X**. The Brain API is visible through the Brain Client package [here](./layerx-core/layerx_brain_client/layerx_brain_client.go)

Get started with [installation documentation](docs/install.md).
